# 00 — Architecture Decision Record (Monorepo)

> **Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-05-28 · **Scope:** project-wide, binding.
>
> This is the authoritative architecture decision record for the monorepo. `AGENTS.md` points here; changes that contradict a decision below must supersede it with a new dated entry, not diverge silently.

## Context

A Bun + TypeScript + Biome **full-stack monorepo** (Bun workspaces): a server, a web client, and a CLI client sharing typed API contracts. The design optimizes for end-to-end type safety without code generation, clear app/package boundaries, and one coherent build/test graph.

---

## ADR-001 — Turborepo + Bun-workspaces layout (orchestration superseded by ADR-006)

**Original decision.** Apps and packages are separated and orchestrated by Turborepo:

```
apps/
  server/   # Hono on Bun.serve — /health + /rpc
  web/      # Vite + React 19, oRPC client
  cli/      # Bun CLI, oRPC client
packages/
  api/      # oRPC contracts + types (single source of truth)
  config/   # zod-based configuration
  db/       # Bun native SQL data access
  utils/    # shared utilities + zod re-export
tooling/typescript/  # shared tsconfig presets (base/server/react)
```

Workspaces reference each other by scope `@<scope>/*`, rewritten in place at `bun run setup` from the root `package.json` name.

**Original rationale.** `apps/*` are deployables, `packages/*` are shared libraries — the split keeps dependencies flowing one direction (apps depend on packages, never the reverse). Turbo originally cached and ordered workspace commands.

**Consequences.** New shared code is a `packages/*` workspace; new deployables are `apps/*`. Cross-cutting tsconfig lives once in `tooling/typescript` and is referenced, not copied.

## ADR-006 — Bun-native workspace orchestration supersedes Turbo

**Decision (2026-07-15).** Preserve the ADR-001 workspace topology, but remove Turbo and orchestrate workspace scripts with Bun's dependency-aware `--filter`. Root `dev` and `build` use `--if-present` because those scripts are intentionally optional across packages.

**Rationale.** The scaffold does not need a second task runner or remote cache. Bun already provides the required workspace selection and dependency ordering, which reduces generated-project dependencies and configuration.

**Consequences.** Generated monorepos contain no active Turbo dependency, configuration, cache cleanup, or operational guidance; this ADR retains the superseded decision as history. The root continues to pin `packageManager: bun@1.3.14`; workspace scripts remain the source of truth for each package's build and test behavior.

## ADR-002 — oRPC contracts as the single source of truth for end-to-end type safety

**Decision.** API shapes are defined as **oRPC contracts** in `packages/api/src/contracts/*` (zod schemas + `oc.input/.output`). The server *implements* them via `implement(planetContract)`; web and CLI clients *consume* only the contract **types** through a typed `ContractRouterClient`.

**Rationale.** A shared contract package gives compile-time-verified type safety from server to every client with **no code generation step** — change a schema and every consumer's types update. Clients import contract types only, never server internals, so the server can refactor freely behind the contract.

**Consequences.** The contract package is the API's authority: every endpoint is added there first, then implemented server-side. Clients must never reach into `apps/server`. zod flows through `packages/utils` so contracts and validation share one copy.

---

## ADR-003 — Hono on `Bun.serve` for the server transport

**Decision.** The server (`apps/server`) is **Hono** mounted on `Bun.serve`. `/health` is a vanilla Hono route; all RPC is served under `/rpc/*` by oRPC's `RPCHandler` bridged into Hono middleware.

**Rationale.** A handful of clients and a contract-driven RPC surface need a real router and middleware pipeline (unlike the single-route `app` mode). Hono is `fetch`-native, fast on Bun, and composes cleanly with the oRPC fetch handler. Routing oRPC under a prefix keeps RPC and plain HTTP (health, future webhooks) side by side.

**Consequences.** `ORPCError` (e.g. `NOT_FOUND`) is part of the contract — it maps to status codes clients discriminate on, so handlers throw typed `ORPCError`, never a generic `Error`. The error interceptor logs only unexpected errors, never deliberate `ORPCError`s.

---

## ADR-004 — Per-client env access; `@<scope>/*` aliases as the boundary

**Decision.** The web and CLI oRPC clients are deliberate twins (`apps/web/src/orpc.ts`, `apps/cli/src/orpc.ts`) that differ only in env access: web uses Vite's build-time `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL`; the CLI uses runtime `process.env.API_URL` (both default to `http://localhost:3000/rpc`). All cross-package imports use `@<scope>/*` aliases.

**Rationale.** Vite and Bun expose configuration through different mechanisms (build-time vs run-time); forcing them into one shared module would leak one runtime's assumptions into the other. Keeping them as parallel files makes the single real difference explicit. Aliases keep package boundaries refactor-safe.

**Consequences.** A change to client-construction logic must be mirrored in both twins. Default dev ports: server `3000`, web `5173`. Config per app lives in its `.env.example`.

---

## ADR-005 — In-memory stores with a test-only reset; Bun-native SQL ready to swap

**Decision.** Demo procedures use an in-memory array (`packages/api` planet store) exposing a test-only `_resetPlanets()`. Real data access is provided as a Bun-native `SQL` pattern in `packages/db` (lazy connection, parameterized queries), ready to back the procedures.

**Rationale.** In-memory keeps the starter runnable with zero infrastructure while demonstrating the full contract→procedure→client flow. The explicit reset lets suites run order-independently (`beforeEach`), never relying on file ordering. `packages/db` shows the sanctioned zero-dependency, injection-safe data pattern for the production swap.

**Consequences.** Swapping the in-memory store for `packages/db` is the expected production step. Any server store must expose a reset and use it in `beforeEach`. No ORM/migration tooling is prescribed; adopting one is a new ADR.

---

## Decisions deliberately deferred

- **Auth / sessions** — none; an auth boundary is a future ADR (likely server middleware + a contract convention).
- **Persistence / migrations** — `packages/db` shows the pattern; the actual DB and migration tooling are deferred to the consuming project.
- **Deployment topology** — apps are independently deployable; orchestration is out of scope here.
